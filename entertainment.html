              <p>Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone must be just as tired as us because of the perpetual discussion on their marriage ever since their alleged...umm...forget it - relationship was sort of made official through myriad antics. Sri Lanka, Switzerland and several other locations were shortlisted and cancelled as their destination wedding spots by gossip columns over the past few months. But folks, sorry to break the bubble, as the Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone wedding ain't happening anytime soon.  </p>

              <h3>With over Rs 130 crore in earnings from its first week worldwide, the film has given Telugu industry its first major blockbuster of the year and a much needed boost from the trade perspective to kick off the summer season in style. As big ticket films such as Bharat Ane Nenu and Naa Peru Surya are gearing up for release, the box office start Rangasthalam has given is beyond exceptional and trade pundits believe it will work in favour of the industry.</h3>
              <p The year didn’t start on a great note for Telugu industry following the disaster of Pawan Kalyan’s Agnyaathavaasi. While there were a few hits such as Bhaagamathie and Tholiprema, the industry badly needed a big scale blockbuster which thankfully, came in the form of Rangasthalam at the right time. Had Rangasthalam failed at the box office, it would’ve affected the subsequent summer releases such as Bharat Ane Nenu and Naa Peru Surya,” trade analyst Trinath told Firstpost..</p>

              <h3>Such projectile-defying stunts — jumps, vaults, kicks — cannot be perfected in a day. One can imagine Tiger prepping for them since school: skipping classes to hang from bars, playing basketball through the mid-terms, guzzling blue Gatorade and moonwalking to glory on Annual Day. From their geeky, wimpy corners, how his friends must've laughed him off -- only to scowl back when he rode away with all the chicks. Wherever those potbellied losers are now, waiting on cut-rate appraisals while Tiger shines on screen, the message has been delivered — the nerds have lost! Shakespeare has embraced protein shakes and Newton has hit the gym.  Even the uptight Gravitational Constant has shrunk in shame to accommodate slo-mo flying-kicks and Tiger's biggest achievement till date, the Helicopter jump.</h3>
